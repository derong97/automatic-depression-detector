## DAIC-WOZ Database Description

This database is part of a larger corpus, the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) (Gratch et al.,2014), that contains clinical interviews designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These interviews were collected as part of a larger effort to create a computer agent that interviews people and identifies verbal and nonverbal indicators of mental illness (DeVault et al., 2014). Data collected include audio and video recordings and extensive questionnaire responses; this part of the corpus includes the Wizard-of-Oz interviews, conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie, controlled by a human interviewer in another room. Data has been transcribed and annotated for a variety of verbal and non-verbal features.

## Project Aim

To assess the severity of the participants' depressive disorders based on predicted PHQ-8 scores using interview transcripts and audio data
